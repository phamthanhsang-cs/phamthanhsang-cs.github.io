# Hi, my name is Sang 
Let’s go back to February 2024. During my time working as an IT Helpdesk, I got the chance to explore an open-source SIEM/XDR platform called Wazuh—and I loved it! However, at that time, all I did was try to spin up the platform, recreate Proof of Concepts (PoCs), and think to myself, "Oh my god, this platform can check file integrity and even tell which contents were modified," or "Oh my god, it can run a VirusTotal scan on a file, flag it as malicious, and even execute a script to delete that file." But honestly, I had no idea what a SIEM was, what an XDR was, or the exact differences between SIEM, XDR, and EDR—or even how XDR/EDR differs from traditional antivirus software like Microsoft Defender or Kaspersky.

By April 2024, I officially left my job to search for new opportunities in the industry. (At the time you're reading this blog, I’m either working as an IT Administrator for an education company or an unemployed individual sharpening my skills to become a SOC Analyst.) During the first month after leaving my IT Helpdesk job, I spent my time diving deeper into IT (fields, jobs, skill requirements, etc.), especially focusing on the Wazuh platform I’d encountered earlier. I started by registering an account on TryHackMe and choosing the SOC Analyst Level 1 path.

That’s when I realized all the skills I had learned so far became incredibly useful. I gained so much knowledge from this course and found myself genuinely wanting to become a SOC Analyst. Around that time, I also discovered a CTF game—yes, Boss of the SOC (I played version 3 at the time). I even attempted to recreate the entire game using a self-hosted setup. It took me a whole week to get it running properly after fixing a bunch of bugs.

After all the effort I put in, I truly believed I had what it took to get a chance as a Security Operations Center (SOC) intern. I even started designing a personal project to build a SOC system (currently known as SOCIMP—I’d really appreciate it if you could check out my project). But I knew I couldn’t rush things. It’s a journey, and you have to move slow if you want to go fast. I needed money to buy a dedicated workstation to host my project, money to register for certification vouchers, and above all, time—time to learn and improve myself.

That’s why I returned to IT. I was lucky enough to land a position as an Administrator. Now - in 2025, I have enough income to start registering for the certifications I need, enough to buy a workstation to build my project, and, above all, just enough knowledge to show you why I’m so hungry to get my foot into the cybersecurity field.
