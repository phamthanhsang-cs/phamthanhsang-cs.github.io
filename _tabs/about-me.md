## Hi, my name is Sang !

Back in February 2024, while working as an IT Helpdesk, I discovered Wazuh, an open-source SIEM/XDR platform, and was amazed by its capabilities: file integrity monitoring, VirusTotal integration, automated threat responses, and more. At the time, though, I barely understood what SIEM, XDR, or EDR really meant.

By April, I left my job to explore new opportunities. I dove deep into IT, focused around Wazuh which is SIEM - XDR and found a role - SOC Analyst, after job requirements researched, and started the SOC Analyst Level 1 path on TryHackMe. That’s when it all clicked, my IT experience was laying the foundation for my cybersecurity journey. I even discovered Boss of the SOC and spent a week recreating it on a self-hosted setup after fixed a bunch of bugs.

Determined to build a future in cybersecurity, I launched my own SOC project. But I realized this journey requires time, resources, and patience. To fund my growth, I returned to IT, lucky enough to work as an IT Administrator, and now in 2025, I’m ready to take the next steps: certifications, building my SOC project, and breaking into the cybersecurity field.
