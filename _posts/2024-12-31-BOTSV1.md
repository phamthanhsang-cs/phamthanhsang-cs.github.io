# Introduction 
### What is Boss of the SOC (BOTS) ?
- **Overview:** BOTS (Boss of the SOC) is a **[blue-team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security))** Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge created by *Splunk*. It gives participants the chance to dive into realistic **security incidents** within enterprise environments, using Splunk as the main platform along with other tools. The challenge involves **analyzing** data, **investigating** threats, and answering questions based on **real-world** scenarios.
- **Purpose:** You could see easily while most CTF challenges are designed for **[red teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team)**, BOTS stands out by focusing on blue teams. It provides a dedicated platform for defenders like us to sharpen our skills. It’s a great way to improve our ability to **detect**, **analyze**, and **identify** incidents in a competitive yet collaborative setting.
- **Tools and techniques:** 
  - **Primary Tool**: Splunk (ofc!) as the core SIEM.
  - **Supporting Skills:** Skills like utilize OSINT, networking fundamentals, cloud computing with AWS and Azure (especially in BOTSv3), web application security, and operating system knowledges all come into play.
  - **Mindset:** Most importantly, success depends on having a **threat-hunting** mindset, thinking beyond the "Splunk box" to creatively identify and analyze threats.
  
### Why i write this walkthrough ?
As I write this in December 2024, I reflect on my experience participating in Boss of the SOC (BOTS) earlier this year, starting in late April 2024. This walkthrough serves two key purposes:
- **Sharing Knowledge:** BOTS gave me invaluable insights into real-world incident response and threat hunting. By documenting my experience, I want to share the strategies and lessons I’ve learned to help others succeed in this unique challenge.
- **Self-Reflection:** Revisiting the challenges and solutions from BOTS allows me to consolidate what I’ve learned and identify areas for improvement. This walkthrough is as much a guide for others as it is a personal milestone in my cybersecurity journey.


### About Boss of the SOC version 1
- **BOTSv1** is the **first-ever** Boss of the SOC (BOTS) event debuted at Splunk **.conf2016**. This initial challenge introduced participants to an engaging and immersive storyline centered around Wayne Corporation—one of the largest and most influential companies in the world, famously associated with Batman (In imagination, ofc xD).

- The scenario begins with a startling incident: the **defacement** of the Wayne Corporation website. As participants, we step into the role of Alice Bluebird' persona, **a security analyst** tasked with conducting a **root cause analysis**. Our mission is to **investigate** the incident, uncover the series of events that led to the attack, and answer a series of questions designed to guide us through the forensic investigation.

# Enviroment setup
- **Pre-requisites:** Participating in Boss of the SOC (BOTS) is easier than ever, thanks to its availability on various platforms:
  - [Splunk Officialy](https://bots.splunk.com/login?redirect=/)
  - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
  - [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)
  
*However, all the walkthroughs in this guide are based on **self-hosted setup**, including more or less what's CTF scoreboard look like. If you'd like to follow along or set up your own environment, check out this [detailed post](https://phamthanhsang-cs.github.io/posts/BOTS-setup/) where we’ll walk through everything step-by-step together, thank you.*

- **Dataset Information:** For this walkthrough, I’m using the complete dataset from BOTSv1, which includes approximately 33 million event records. This dataset is notably challenging due to the mix of **legitimate activity**, **noisy data**, and **attack events**. While it adds complexity, it also provides an excellent opportunity to hone our search and analysis skills, making the experience both rewarding and comprehensive.

# Walkthrough 
### Let's Splunking !
Before deep diving into answer BOTS questions, i would like to prepare some SPL searches to make my life easier since me and you are going to "Black box hunting", right ?
- First is `|metadata index="botsv1" type=sourcetypes | stats values(sourcetype)`, the following SPL command helps me quickly identify the sourcetypes present in the dataset. This gives me a clear idea of the types of data we should focus on during investigation:
- The second one is `|metasearch index="botsv1" sourcetype=<specific_sourcetype> <keyword>`, this command helps me pinpoint specific data sources based on your investigation's context and keywords. For example, if the challenge involves a web application security question, and have some sort of keywords like "injection" or "spoofing." While this could involve multiple sourcetypes such as HTTP logs, firewall logs, or IDS/IPS logs, this command helps narrow the scope. It provides a starting point for which sourcetypes are most likely to contain the relevant information.
- The third one is `|fieldsummary` with [marcro](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchmacro) setup. My search will look like this:

```sql
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
```
*And i'd set this search with marcro named `spog` (sing pane of glass), you will see why those searches helped me so much in this walkthrough.*


#### Question 1 (101): What is the likely IP address of someone from the Po1s0n1vy group scanning imreallynotbatman.com for web application vulnerabilities?

![pic1](assets/images/botsv1/pic1.png){: w="250" h="50" }{: .right }

Firstly, let's take a look at our sourcetypes by using `|metadata index="botsv1" type=sourcetypes | stats values(sourcetype)` to see if there are any relevant types of data we could start with. Since the question is about an external IP address related to Po1s0n1vy scanning a website, we could start with these sourcetypes:
 - fortigate_*
 - stream:http
 - suricata 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Let's start with `fortigate_*` sourcetypes, use this SPL search with keyword is "imreallynotbatman.com":
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* imreallynotbatman.com 
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
or do `spog` instead
```
![pic2](/assets/images/botsv1/pic2.png){: w="270" h="100" }{: .right }
Seems like we found something here, dive diving into that by using this SPL search:

```log
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* imreallynotbatman.com attack="Acunetix.Web.Vulnerability.Scanner"
|table srcip dstip
|stats count by srcip dstip
```

You could see the IP Address of the external IP was trying to scan the Web Server:
```shell
srcip           dstip             count
40.80.148.42    192.168.250.40    1
40.80.148.42    192.168.250.70    4144
```
**ANSWER: 40.80.148.42**
<br>
<br>

#### Question 2 (102): What company created the web vulnerability scanner used by Po1s0n1vy? Type the company name. (For example "Microsoft" or "Oracle")
Based on previous question and googling, we already know that the advesary is using [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) by Invicti - A Web Application and API Security Scanner.

**ANSWER: Acunetix**

#### Question 3 (103): What content management system is imreallynotbatman.com likely using?(Please do not include punctuation such as . , ! ? in your answer. We are looking for alpha characters only.)

First thing, what's CMS ? Content management system is a web application or software that manages digital content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish from a single dashboard. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.

Some of the best and most popular CMS providers that we might see in Internet are:
- Wordpress (this one has a lot of security issues tbh)
- Hubspot
- Joomla
- Magento
...etc

So, which one is using by Wayne Corp ? We already knew that 192.168.250.70 is the internal IP Address of the Web Server, so let's use that clue to investigate. Let's start with this search, we will looking for the most interesting fields that we want to focus on:
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:http" 192.168.250.70
| head 1000
| fieldsummary 
| fields field
```
That's a lot of fields (99 fields) we have to looking to, so i deciced to do some research "How to detect CMS of a Website", and got this answer:
`A website's content management system (CMS) can be identified by examining the URL that links to the website's administration panel. If adding /wp-admin/ to the end of a domain name in the address bar took you to a page with a login and password entry.`

With that information, let's go back to Splunk and focus on three fields that i think are the most relevant: `uri` , `uri_path` and `uri_query`. Let's search using these fields:
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:http" 192.168.250.70 
| head 10000
| table uri uri_path uri_query
| stats count by uri
| sort - count
```
![pic3](/assets/images/botsv1/pic3.png)
_Well, look what we got here, and also notice the one uri that looks really really suspicious_

**ANSWER: joomla**

#### Question 4 (104): What is the name of the file that defaced the imreallynotbatman.com website? Please submit only the name of the file with extension (For example "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico") 

The first thought I had when encountering this question was: "It has to be an image and is likely represented on the front-end side of an application". According to Trend Micro, "Website defacement is similar to drawing graffiti on a wall, only it happens virtually. A website’s appearance changes, with pictures and/or words scrawled across the defaced site."

We already know that we found a suspicious file named `poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg` in Question 3 (103). Now, let's analyze what happened.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=* poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg
```
Only 10 events, great! We're optimizing our search capabilities from the beginning until now.

I found this log in `suricata`, so we can assume that Wayne Corp's web server was compromised and requested a resource from an unknown external server named `prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com:1337` for an image.

```log
{ [-]
   dest_ip: 23.22.63.114
   dest_port: 1337
   event_type: http
   flow_id: 2457936270
   http: { [-]
     hostname: prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com
     http_method: GET
     length: 0
     protocol: HTTP/1.0
     url: /poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg
   }

   timestamp: 2016-08-10T16:10:21.601458-0600
   tx_id: 0
}
```
Fortigate Unified Threat Management - `fortigate_utm` also flaged it as `Malicous Websites`.
```log

```
**ANSWER: poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg**

#### Question 5 (105): This attack used dynamic DNS to resolve to the malicious IP. What fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is associated with this attack?
First, let's ask ourselves "What's dynamic DNS" and "What's FQDN ?"
- Dynamic DNS or DDNS: "Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that keeps the DNS updated with a web property's correct IP address, even if that IP address is constantly being updated." - Cloudflare. *I previously configured DDNS for my company on a Mikrotik router and Fortigate firewall, tracking their IP addresses every minute. This helped maintain their VPN site-to-site connection and minimized disruption. However, the company later switched to using a static IP to simplify the process and eliminate downtime.*  
  
- Fully qualified domain name or FQDN: A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a complete domain name that specifies the exact location of a computer or a host on the internet. It consists of a hostname and a domain name. You can see picture below to get the idea what FQDN is.

_cre:hostinger_

Based on Question 4 (104) investigation, we will get the right answer for this question.

**ANSWERS: prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com**

#### Question 6 (106): What IP address has Po1s0n1vy tied to domains that are pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprises?

Alright, from the first question, we already know that 40.80.148.42 is the external IP address that performed reconnaissance, and 23.22.63.114 is the IP address of the server that transferred the image used to deface the imreallynotbatman.com website, which has already been compromised. We also know that Po1s0n1vy used DDNS to resolve to the malicious IP.

So, what could be the IP address pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprises?
```text
After detected the vulnerabilities in Jooma CMS, Po1s0n1vy used their infrastructure to exploit that vulnerable Web Server

This could involve techniques such as injection, path traversal, XSS, brute forcing, etc., followed by an HTTP GET request to the server hosting the defaced image.  

The domain or server transferring the suspicious image is likely a pre-staged setup.
```

**ANSWER: 23.22.63.114**

#### Question 7 (107): Based on the data gathered from this attack and common open source intelligence sources for domain names, what is the email address that is most likely associated with Po1s0n1vy APT group?

Based on MITRE ATT&CK, the adversary used T1491.002 - Defacement: External Defacement to compromise Batman's website `(71.39.18.126)`. But how did the attacker achieve this?

We can assume that Po1s0n1vy successfully conducted a web scan on Wayne Corp's public IP address, which was used to NAT imreallynotbatman.com (192.168.250.70) to the internet. They likely exploited a vulnerability in the Joomla CMS and subsequently defaced the website.

![pic5](/assets/images/botsv1/pic5.png)

First, let’s use one of my favorite OSINT tools - VirusTotal. When I searched for the malicious domain `prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com`, we identified the associated IP address: `23.22.63.114` which is pre-staged setup to attack the website. Continuing the investigation with this IP address, I found the following relationships:

```bash
Date resolved           Detections          Resolver         Domain
2019-12-01              0 / 94              VirusTotal       waynecorinc.com
.... 
....
2018-07-18              0 / 94              VirusTotal       www.po1s0n1vy.com
```
The domain `www.po1s0n1vy.com` seemed promising for the investigation, but after exploring [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/www.po1s0n1vy.com), i still got no chance to find the email of the adversary. So, i moved to the second tool - [AlienVault](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/hostname/www.po1s0n1vy.com). Using the same method - put the `23.22.63.114` on it and clicked on the same domain `www.po1s0n1vy.com`. Look what i got here:

**ANSWER: lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com**

#### Question 8 (108): What IP address is likely attempting a brute force password attack against imreallynotbatman.com?
Based on the previous questions and the keyword `brute force`, we can assume that the adversary discovered that Joomla or the website lacked Layer 7 protections such as a WAF, input validation, or an account lockout policy. Without an IPS in place and only IDS, they likely attempted a brute-force password attack against the website. To carry out this attack, Po1s0n1vy would have likely sent `GET` and `POST` requests to the server. And which account would typically be the most targeted by default? Yes, it's the `admin` or `administrator` account.

"A brute force attack can manifest in many different ways, but it primarily involves an attacker configuring predetermined values, making requests to a server using those values, and then analyzing the response. To improve efficiency, the attacker may use a dictionary attack (with or without mutations) or a traditional brute-force attack (using predefined character classes such as alphanumeric, special characters, or case sensitivity). Given the method, number of attempts, and efficiency of both the attacking and defending systems, the attacker can estimate how long it will take to submit all chosen predetermined values." — OWASP

Let's dive into the event with the SPL search:
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http src_ip=23.22.63.114 OR src_ip=40.80.148.42 AND "admin" OR "administrator"
`spog`
```
Well, only 458 events, let's start investigating. 

We found something ! 
```log

....
```

Let’s see which IP address is responsible for these "nasty" activities.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http "admin" src_content=username*
|table src_ip dest_ip
|stats count by src_ip dest_ip
```
![pic6](/assets/images/botsv1/pic6.png)

**ANSWER: 23.22.63.114**

#### Question 9 (109): What is the name of the executable uploaded by Po1s0n1vy? Please include file extension. (For example, "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico")

Based on previous SPL searches, we not only know which IP address was used to brute-force the attack on the website, but we also know that imreallynotbatman.com was running Microsoft IIS version 8.5
```log
dest_header
HTTP/1.1 303 See other\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nLocation: http://imreallynotbatman.com/joomla/administrator/index.php\r\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\r\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.38\r\nDate: Wed, 10 Aug 2016 21:46:15 GMT\r\nConnection: close\r\nContent-Length: 182\r\n\r\n
```
What do you think when you get this information? Yup, the executable uploaded by Po1s0n1vy could be any .exe or .ps1 file. Let’s search using the clues we have.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* *.exe OR *.ps1
`spog`
```

We got those field - value after that we could looking into.
```log
category        Unrated
                W32/Swrort.C!tr
```
```log
file_name       cmd.exe
                3791.exe
                ZAk5LbgaGf.exe
                le_check_v3.exe
                shtml.exe
```
Did some researches, i got this information: 
"W32/Swrort.C!tr is classified as a Trojan.
Trojan has the capabilities to remote access connection handling, perform Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed DoS (DDoS), capture keyboard inputs, delete file or object, or terminate process.
The Fortinet Anti-Virus Analyst Team is currently in the process of creating a detailed description for this virus." - Fortiguard

So let's start with that IoC first.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* category="W32/Swrort.C!tr"
```

**ANSWER: 3791.exe**

#### Question 10 (110): What is the MD5 hash of the executable uploaded?
Based on previous analyzed, we also got this MD5 hash.

**ANSWER: aae3f5a29935e6abcc2c2754d12a9af0**

#### Question 11 (111): GCPD reported that common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) for the Po1s0n1vy APT group, if initial compromise fails, is to send a spear phishing email with custom malware attached to their intended target. This malware is usually connected to Po1s0n1vys initial attack infrastructure. Using research techniques, provide the SHA256 hash of this malware.

If you guys don't know what's GCPD ? Well, GCPD stands for [Gotham City Police Department](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Gotham_City_Police_Department) which is a municipal police force of Gotham City in DC Comics. 

Alright, let's revisit the scenario and build on my earlier hypothesis, but this time consider a different situation where Po1s0n1vy failed to compromise the web server. In this case, they might attempt a phishing attack using the email address `lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com` to target Wayne Corp employees, exploiting the system through "human error" We already know that this email is associated with the IP address `23.22.63.114`.

Updated Hypothesis:
```text
After detected the vulnerabilities in Jooma CMS, Po1s0n1vy used their infrastructure to exploit that vulnerable Web Server.

This could involve techniques such as injection, path traversal, XSS, brute forcing, etc., followed by an HTTP GET request to the server hosting the defaced image.  

If Po1s0n1vy failed to compromise the web server. In this case, they might attempt a phishing attack using the email address `lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com` to target Wayne Corp employees, exploiting the system through "human error".
```

This type of situation typically calls for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools to gather information. After exploring resources like VirusTotal, Abuse.ch, AlienVault, and AbuseIPDB, i uncovered some interesting findings using Hybrid Analysis—a free malware analysis service.

_But which one ?_

Scrolling down to the File Details section, we find something particularly noteworthy:

The first one file name `MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe`

The second one file name `ec78c938d8453739ca2a370b9c275971ec46caf6e479de2b2d04e97cc47fa45d` shares the same MD5 and SHA256 hash values as `3791.exe`, which we identified earlier as the malware the adversary uploaded to the imreallynotbatman.com web server.

#### Question 12 (112): What special hex code is associated with the customized malware discussed in question 111? (Hint: It's not in Splunk)

From previous question, we'd gathered IoCs below: 
- Filename: `MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe`
- Type: `peexe`, `excutable`
- SHA256: `9709473ab351387aab9e816eff3910b9f28a7a70202e250ed46dba8f820f34a8`
- MD5: `c99131e0169171935c5ac32615ed6261`
- SHA1: `bc927ff06263351f43db8dec88e4b08485e07996`
- Contacted Host: `23.22.63.114:80` (UDP)

#### Question 13 (113): One of Po1s0n1vy's staged domains has some disjointed "unique" whois information. Concatenate the two codes together and submit as a single answer.
This question might be the toughest so far, in my opinion. It not only teaches us how to find the right OSINT tools for an investigation but also challenges us to use them effectively.

*Honestly, this question made me feel like the worst Alice Bluebird Analyst ever. It’s clear I still have so much to improve, haha.*

The first thought that came to mind was to spin up some Whois lookups to gather information about the domain. I decided to start with AlienVault, as it’s one of my favorite tools. Let’s see if it reveals any clues.

![pic19](/assets/images/botsv1/pic19.png)

In addition to common adversary domains like `*.po1s0n1vy.com` and `prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com`, I noticed something interesting: a lot of mistyped domains resembling Wayne Corp’s legitimate site (possibly waynecorpinc.com).

This observation led to an update in my hypothesis:

The adversary likely set up **fake domains** mimicking Wayne Corp’s official website. These domains could be used to:
- Lure users into visiting the fake site.
- Deliver malware directly to unsuspecting visitors.

<p id="hypothesis">Our hypothesis so far:</p>
> - After detected the vulnerabilities in Jooma CMS, Po1s0n1vy used their infrastructure to exploit that vulnerable Web Server.
- This could involve techniques such as injection, path traversal, XSS, brute forcing, etc., followed by an HTTP GET request to the server hosting the defaced image.  
- If Po1s0n1vy failed to compromise the web server. In this case, they might attempt a phishing attack using the email address `lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com` to target Wayne Corp employees, exploiting the system through "human error".
- The adversary also set up **fake domains** mimicking Wayne Corp’s official website. These domains could be used to:
  - Lure users into visiting the fake site for sensitive credential / information harvesting.
  - Deliver malware directly to unsuspecting visitors.
{: .prompt-info }


*Well we now know we are encounter against an APT Group - [Hacktivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism#:~:text=Hacktivism%20(or%20hactivism%3B%20a%20portmanteau,political%20agenda%20or%20social%20change.)) with sophisticated cyberattacks*<br><br>

Below are MITRE ATT&CK techniques you could use to get more information about that:
- [Acquire Infrastructure: Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001/) - T1583.001 - Resource Development
- [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/) - T1189 - Initial Access

The challenge, however, asked a specific question:

Which staged domains have disjointed and “unique” Whois information?

I tried several tools, including VirusTotal, AlienVault, WhoIsFreak, Abuse.ch, and WhoisDomain Lookup, but couldn’t find a clear lead.. So i use the 2nd hint and got this suggestion:

*""Use a high quality whois site like www.domaintools.com to perform whois lookups against these domains until you see a hex code where you were expecting text. Warning not all whois sites show you all fields!""*

After researching (Well i mean, took me an entire day), i found a way to get more advanced informations about a domain - use whois api tools and get `Json` or `xml` format data. 

One tool stood out: [WhoisJson API](https://whoisjson.com) - a service that provides real-time domain registration data by performing queries on WHOIS servers.

Start with the first staged domains that lists on AlienVault scanned: `waynecorinc.com`. Using Postman, I queried the domain with my WhoisJson API key and, finally...

FOUND IT !!!

#### Question 14 (114): What was the first brute force password used?

Based on Question 8 (108), we just to need add `|reverse` to our SPL search to find which is the first password adversary was used to brute force.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http "admin" src_content=username*
|reverse
|table _time src_content
```
![pic9](/assets/images/botsv1/pic9.png)

**ANSWER: 12345678**

#### Question 15 (115): One of the passwords in the brute force attack is James Brodsky's favorite Coldplay song. Hint: we are looking for a six character word on this one. Which is it?
This one’s a bit tricky! Looking back at the previous question, we already have a field value that gives us part of the answer:

```log
username=admin&863349a657c211fbfeb90ebe9427654c=1&task=login&return=aW5kZXgucGhw&option=com_login&passwd=letmein
```
Now, let’s take it a step further with an advanced search using the `rex` command. The goal is to extract only the `username` and `passwd` fields (e.g., username=admin ; passwd=letmein) and then filter the results to list only passwords that are exactly six characters long.

```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http src_content=username*
| reverse
| table src_content
| rex field=src_content "username=(?<username>[^&]+).*?passwd=(?<passwd>[^&]+)"
| where len(passwd) == 6
| stats values(passwd)
```
Meanwhile, let’s do a bit of “OSINT” on Coldplay’s songs using Wikipedia, focusing specifically on their singles.

I’ll create a table with two columns: one for `value(passwd)` and another for `Coldplay’s Songs`.

```log

As you can see, "Shiver" and "Yellow" are 2 songs that have six characters, look into the value(passwd), we now are able to find the correct one ! 

**ANSWER: yellow**

Anyway, you should give a chance for "Adventure of a Lifetime" which is my fav back then.

#### Question 16 (116): What was the correct password for admin access to the content management system running "imreallynotbatman.com"?
Building on our previous questions and SPL searches, we used the following query to extract the usernames and passwords from brute force attempts targeting the Joomla CMS Administrator credentials:
```sql
index=botsv1 sourtype=suricata src_content=username*
| _time table src_content
| rex field=src_content "username=(?<username>[^&]+).*?passwd=(?<passwd>[^&]+)"
| table _time username passwd
```

_The search resulted in 413 event records, providing a list of username-password combinations used during the brute force attack._

The immediate thought came to me is that the **last password** used in the brute force sequence is the one that successfully compromised the CMS. Why?

- Evidence of Compromised:
  - Alerts from Fortigate UTM and Suricata confirm that imreallynotbatman.com has already been compromised.
- Adversary’s Methodology:
 - The attack was conducted via HTTP GET and POST requests, using a combination of usernames and passwords against the Joomla administrator at `/joomla/administrator/index.php`.

But, that’s too simplistic and doesn’t guarantee accuracy. Instead, me and you need to dig deeper and hunt for **Indicators of Compromised** (IoCs) that validate the successful login.

Before diving back into the hunt, I want to share a fantastic resource with you: [PEAK Threat Hunting](https://github.com/splunk/PEAK?tab=readme-ov-file) - PEAK, an acronym for "Prepare, Execute, and Act with Knowledge," brings a fresh perspective to threat hunting. It incorporates three distinct types of hunts: 
1. Hypothesis-Driven
2. Baseline (AKA Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA)
3. Model-Assisted Threat Hunts (M-ATH)

As I mentioned earlier: 
> *"Most importantly, success depends on having a **threat-hunting** mindset, thinking beyond the "Splunk box" to creatively identify and analyze threats."*

Throughout this walkthrough, we’ve been working to create [hypothesis](#hypothesis) to guide our investigation. So, rely on PEAK Threat Hunting model, we decided to use 1st hunt type - Hypothesis-Driven

![pic22](/assets/images/botsv1/pic22.png)
_Hypothesis-driven threat hunting method_

With this hunting method, we working around our above assume - that is the **last password** used in the brute force sequence is the one that successfully compromised the CMS.

First, go back to `stream:http` sourcetype, we are now looking for worthy fields that could give us potential indicators.

```sql
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http imreallynotbatman.com 
```
Look into field `src_header`, this field looks interesting to me.

![pic24](/assets/images/botsv1/pic24.png)

```sql
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http imreallynotbatman.com src_content=username* 
| table _time src_ip dest_ip src_headers src_content
| sort -_time
```

![pic25](/assets/images/botsv1/pid25.png)
_Seems like we found something different here_

**ANSWER: batman**


#### Question 17 (117): What was the average password length used in the password brute forcing attempt? (Round to closest whole integer. For example "5" not "5.23213")
This question challenge you know how to use SPL commands, to solve this question we need to know length of all password brute forcing attempts and then calculate the average password length.

```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http src_content=username*
| reverse
| table src_content
| rex field=src_content "username=(?<username>[^&]+).*?passwd=(?<passwd>[^&]+)" # you already knew what these command is use for based on previous questions
| eval passwd_length = len(passwd) # We create a new field name `passwd_length` that contains the length of password using `len` command
| table passwd passwd_length # list all needed fields
| where passwd_length > 0 # (optional) in case adversaries might start with non-password login 
| stats avg(passwd_length) # Returns the average of the values which is `passwd_length`

Result: 6.174334140435835
```
**ANSWER: 6**

#### Question 18 (118): How many seconds elapsed between the time the brute force password scan identified the correct password and the compromised login? Round to 2 decimal places.

From the previous question, we confirmed that after the Joomla Administrator credentials were compromised (through a brute force attack via a **Python script** originating from IP Address `23.22.63.114`), the adversary successfully logged in using the stolen credentials (admin / batman). This activity was observed coming from a different IP address, `40.80.148.42`.

Both IP addresses have been flagged as **malicious** based on our analysis, allowing us to efficiently query the data for further insights by focusing on relevant keywords.

```sql
index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http imreallynotbatman.com src_content=username* AND src_content=*batman*
| table _time src_ip dest_ip src_headers src_content
| sort -_time
| delta _time #i'd used 2nd Hint and get this SPL command recommendation for calculate elapsed time

result=-92.169084
```
![pic27](/assets/images/botsv1/pic27.png)

**ANSWER: 92.17**


#### Question 19 (119): How many unique passwords were attempted in the brute force attempt?
For this question, we have to remove the duplicated value in those password brute force attempts. We are going to use [dedup](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/SearchReference/Dedup) for remove duplicate values of the `passwd` field, leaving only the first occurrence of each unique value.

```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http src_content=username* 
| reverse
| table src_content
| rex field=src_content "username=(?<username>[^&]+).*?passwd=(?<passwd>[^&]+)" 
| dedup passwd
| table passwd
```
![pic23](/assets/images/botsv1/pic23.png)

**ANSWER: 412**

*But, which password has more than 1 time attempt ?* 
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http src_content=username* 
| reverse
| table src_content
| rex field=src_content "username=(?<username>[^&]+).*?passwd=(?<passwd>[^&]+)" 
| stats count by passwd
| where count > 1
| table passwd
```
*Well, it's `batman` which is the password they cracked successfully to gain Joomla Administrator access*
