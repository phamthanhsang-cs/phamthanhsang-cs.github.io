### What is Boss of the SOC (BOTS) ?
- **Overview:** BOTS (Boss of the SOC) is a blue-team Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge developed by Splunk. It immerses participants in realistic security incidents within enterprise environments, leveraging Splunk as the primary platform alongside other tools. Participants analyze data, investigate threats, and answer questions based on "real-world" scenarios.  
- **Purpose:** You could see easily while most CTF challenges cater to red teams, BOTS focuses on empowering blue teams by providing a dedicated platform for defenders to hone our skills. Itâ€™s a unique opportunity for us to sharpen our detection, analysis, and incident response capabilities in a competitive yet collaborative environment.
- **Tools and techniques:** 
  - **Primary Tool**: Splunk (ofc!) as the core SIEM.
  - **Supporting Skills:** Utilizing OSINTs, networking fundamentals, cloud computing services including AWS and Azure (particularly emphasized in BOTSv3), web application security, and operating system knowledge.
  - **Mindset:** Above all, success requires a threat-hunting mindset, thinking outside the "Splunk" box to creatively identify and analyze threats.
