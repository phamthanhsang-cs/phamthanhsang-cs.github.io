# Introduction 
### What is Boss of the SOC (BOTS) ?
- **Overview:** BOTS (Boss of the SOC) is a **[blue-team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security))** Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge created by *Splunk*. It gives participants the chance to dive into realistic **security incidents** within enterprise environments, using Splunk as the main platform along with other tools. The challenge involves **analyzing** data, **investigating** threats, and answering questions based on **real-world** scenarios.
- **Purpose:** You could see easily while most CTF challenges are designed for **[red teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team)**, BOTS stands out by focusing on blue teams. It provides a dedicated platform for defenders like us to sharpen our skills. It’s a great way to improve our ability to **detect**, **analyze**, and **identify** incidents in a competitive yet collaborative setting.
- **Tools and techniques:** 
  - **Primary Tool**: Splunk (ofc!) as the core SIEM.
  - **Supporting Skills:** Skills like utilize OSINT, networking fundamentals, cloud computing with AWS and Azure (especially in BOTSv3), web application security, and operating system knowledges all come into play.
  - **Mindset:** Most importantly, success depends on having a **threat-hunting** mindset, thinking beyond the "Splunk box" to creatively identify and analyze threats.
  
### Why i write this walkthrough ?
As I write this in December 2024, I reflect on my experience participating in Boss of the SOC (BOTS) earlier this year, starting in late April 2024. This walkthrough serves two key purposes:
- **Sharing Knowledge:** BOTS gave me invaluable insights into real-world incident response and threat hunting. By documenting my experience, I want to share the strategies and lessons I’ve learned to help others succeed in this unique challenge.
- **Self-Reflection:** Revisiting the challenges and solutions from BOTS allows me to consolidate what I’ve learned and identify areas for improvement. This walkthrough is as much a guide for others as it is a personal milestone in my cybersecurity journey.


### About Boss of the SOC version 1
- **BOTSv1** is the **first-ever** Boss of the SOC (BOTS) event debuted at Splunk **.conf2016**. This initial challenge introduced participants to an engaging and immersive storyline centered around Wayne Corporation—one of the largest and most influential companies in the world, famously associated with Batman (In imagination, ofc xD).

- The scenario begins with a startling incident: the **defacement** of the Wayne Corporation website. As participants, we step into the role of Alice Bluebird' persona, **a security analyst** tasked with conducting a **root cause analysis**. Our mission is to **investigate** the incident, uncover the series of events that led to the attack, and answer a series of questions designed to guide us through the forensic investigation.

# Enviroment setup
- **Pre-requisites:** Participating in Boss of the SOC (BOTS) is easier than ever, thanks to its availability on various platforms:
  - [Splunk Officialy](https://bots.splunk.com/login?redirect=/)
  - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
  - [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)
  
*However, all the walkthroughs in this guide are based on **self-hosted setup**, including more or less what's CTF scoreboard look like. If you'd like to follow along or set up your own environment, check out this [detailed post](https://phamthanhsang-cs.github.io/posts/BOTS-setup/) where we’ll walk through everything step-by-step together, thank you.*

- **Dataset Information:** For this walkthrough, I’m using the complete dataset from BOTSv1, which includes approximately 33 million event records. This dataset is notably challenging due to the mix of **legitimate activity**, **noisy data**, and **attack events**. While it adds complexity, it also provides an excellent opportunity to hone our search and analysis skills, making the experience both rewarding and comprehensive.

# Walkthrough 
### Let's Splunking !
Before deep diving into answer BOTS questions, i would like to prepare some SPL searches to make my life easier since me and you are going to "Black box hunting", right ?
- First is `|metadata index="botsv1" type=sourcetypes | stats values(sourcetype)`, the following SPL command helps me quickly identify the sourcetypes present in the dataset. This gives me a clear idea of the types of data we should focus on during investigation:
- The second one is `|metasearch index="botsv1" sourcetype=<specific_sourcetype> <keyword>`, this command helps me pinpoint specific data sources based on your investigation's context and keywords. For example, if the challenge involves a web application security question, and have some sort of keywords like "injection" or "spoofing." While this could involve multiple sourcetypes such as HTTP logs, firewall logs, or IDS/IPS logs, this command helps narrow the scope. It provides a starting point for which sourcetypes are most likely to contain the relevant information.
- The third one is `|fieldsummary` with [marcro](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchmacro) setup. My search will look like this:

```sql
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
```
*And i'd set this search with marcro named `spog` (sing pane of glass), you will see why those searches helped me so much in this walkthrough.*


#### Question 1 (101): What is the likely IP address of someone from the Po1s0n1vy group scanning imreallynotbatman.com for web application vulnerabilities?

![pic1](assets/images/botsv1/pic1.png){: w="250" h="50" }{: .right }

Firstly, let take a look into our sourcetypes by using `|metadata index="botsv1" type=sourcetypes | stats values(sourcetype)` to see if there are any relevant types of data we could starting with. Because the question is about an external IP Address from Po1s0n1vy scanning a website. We could start with these sourcetypes:
 - fortigate_*
 - stream:http
 - suricata 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Let's start with `fortigate_*` sourcetypes, i will this SPL search with keyword is "imreallynotbatman.com":
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* imreallynotbatman.com 
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
or do `spog` instead
```
![pic2](/assets/images/botsv1/pic2.png){: w="270" h="100" }{: .right }
Seems like we found something here, dive diving into that by using this SPL search:

`index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* imreallynotbatman.com attack="Acunetix.Web.Vulnerability.Scanner"
|table srcip dstip
|stats count by srcip dstip`

You could see the IP Address of the external IP was trying to scan the Web Server:
```shell
srcip           dstip             count
40.80.148.42    192.168.250.40    1
40.80.148.42    192.168.250.70    4144
```
**ANSWER: 40.80.148.42**
<br>
<br>

#### Question 2 (102): What company created the web vulnerability scanner used by Po1s0n1vy? Type the company name. (For example "Microsoft" or "Oracle")
Based on previous question and googling, we already know that the advesary is using [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) by Invicti - A Web Application and API Security Scanner.

**ANSWER: Acunetix**

#### Question 3 (103): What content management system is imreallynotbatman.com likely using?(Please do not include punctuation such as . , ! ? in your answer. We are looking for alpha characters only.)

First thing, what's CMS ? Content management system is a web application or software that manages digital content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish from a single dashboard. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.

Some of the best and most popular CMS providers that we might see in Internet are:
- Wordpress (this one has a lot of security issues tbh)
- Hubspot
- Joomla
- Magento
...etc

So, which one is using by Wayne Corp ? We already knew that 192.168.250.70 is internal IP Address of the Web Server, so let's use that clue to investigate. Let's start with this search, we will looking for the most interesting fields that we want to focus on:
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:http" 192.168.250.70
| head 1000
| fieldsummary 
| fields field
```
That's a lot of fields (99 field) we have to looking to, so i deciced to do some research "How to detect CMS of a Website", and i got this answer:
`A website's content management system (CMS) can be identified by examining the URL that links to the website's administration panel. If adding /wp-admin/ to the end of a domain name in the address bar took you to a page with a login and password entry.`

With that information, i go back to my Splunk and focus on 3 fields that i think those are the most relevant - `uri` , `uri_path` and `uri_query`. Let's search using these fields:
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype="stream:http" 192.168.250.70 
| head 10000
| table uri uri_path uri_query
| stats count by uri
| sort - count
```
![pic3](/assets/images/botsv1/pic3.png)
_Well, look what we got here, and also notice one uri that looks really really suspicious in those uri_

**ANSWER: joomla**

#### Question 4 (104): What is the name of the file that defaced the imreallynotbatman.com website? Please submit only the name of the file with extension (For example "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico") 

The first thought when i encountered this question is - "it has to be an image and represent mostly on Front End side of an application". Based on Trendmicro - `Website defacement is similar to drawing graffiti on a wall, only it happens virtually. Websites’ appearance change - pictures and/or words are scrawled across the defaced website.`

And we already knew that we found one suspicious file name `poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg` in Question 3 (103), but let's analyze - what's happened.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=* poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg
```
Only 10 events, good ! We are optimizing our search capabilities from the start till now.  
I got this log from `suricata`. So we could assume that the Wayne Corp' Web Server was compromised and it asked for the resource from other unknow external server named `prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com:1337` for an image.

```log
{ [-]
   dest_ip: 23.22.63.114
   dest_port: 1337
   event_type: http
   flow_id: 2457936270
   http: { [-]
     hostname: prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com
     http_method: GET
     length: 0
     protocol: HTTP/1.0
     url: /poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg
   }
   in_iface: eth1
   proto: TCP
   src_ip: 192.168.250.70
   src_port: 56504
   timestamp: 2016-08-10T16:10:21.601458-0600
   tx_id: 0
}
```
Fortigate Unified Threat Management also flaged it as `Malicous Websites`.
```log

```
**ANSWER: poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg**

#### Question 5 (105): This attack used dynamic DNS to resolve to the malicious IP. What fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is associated with this attack?
First, let's ask yourself "What's dynamic DNS" and "What's FQDN ?"
- Dynamic DNS or DDNS: "Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that keeps the DNS updated with a web property's correct IP address, even if that IP address is constantly being updated." - Cloudflare. *I was configed DDNS for my previous company on Mikrotik Router and Fortigate Firewall,tracking their IP addresses once every minute which is helped them maintaining their VPN Site to Site connection, minimized disruption, but the company moved to using Static IP after for simplify the process and no downtime.*  
- Fully qualified domain name or FQDN: A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a complete domain name that specifies the exact location of a computer or a host on the internet. It consists of a hostname and a domain name. You can see picture below to get the idea what FQDN is.

_cre:hostinger_

Based on Question 4 (104) investigation, we will get the right answer for this question.

**ANSWERS: prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com**

#### Question 6 (106): What IP address has Po1s0n1vy tied to domains that are pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprises?

Alright, from the first question, we already knew that `40.80.148.42` is the External IP Address that did reconnaissance, and `23.22.63.114` is the IP Address of the server transfered the image that used to Deface imreallynotbatman.com website - which is already compromised, and also knew that Po1s0n1vy used DDNS to resolve to the malicious IP. So, what would be the IP Address that are pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprises ? 

So my hypotheosis will be: 
```text
After detected the vulnerabilities in Jooma CMS, Po1s0n1vy used their infrastructure to exploit that vulnerable Web Server

Could be something like Injection, Path Traversal, XSS, or Brute Forcing,etc and then HTTP GET to the server that was holding the deface image. 

That FTP or whatever transfer the suspicious image is pre-staged domain.
```

**ANSWER: 23.22.63.114**

#### Question 7 (107): Based on the data gathered from this attack and common open source intelligence sources for domain names, what is the email address that is most likely associated with Po1s0n1vy APT group?

Based on [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002/), the adversary used T1491.001 - Defacement: Internal Defacement to defaced Batman's website. But....how the attacker did that ? It's a local Web Server, right ? So, we could assume that Po1s0n1vy was able to fire a phishing campaign successfully and then from that compromised account / machine,...they did web scan, exploited the jooma CMS vulnerability and defaced the website. 

![pic5](/assets/images/botsv1/pic5.png)

First is one of my favorite OSINT - Virus Total, when i try to put the IP Address `23.22.63.114` on it, i got these relations:

```bash
Date resolved           Detections          Resolver         Domain
2019-12-01              0 / 94              VirusTotal       waynecorinc.com
.... 
....
2018-07-18              0/94                VirusTotal       www.po1s0n1vy.com
```
The one `www.po1s0n1vy.com` looks promise for a investigation, but after stumbled around [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/www.po1s0n1vy.com), i still got no chance to find the email of the adversary, i moved to the second one - [AlienVault](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/hostname/www.po1s0n1vy.com) and using the same method - put the `23.22.63.114` on it and clicked on the same domain `www.po1s0n1vy.com`. Look what i got here:

**ANSWER: lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com**

#### Question 8 (108): What IP address is likely attempting a brute force password attack against imreallynotbatman.com?
Based on previous questions and "brute force" as the keyword, we can assume that the adversary detected that Joomla or the website doesn't have any sort of Layer 7 protection like WAF or any input validation method or account lockout policy, so they was trying to bruteforce password attack against the website. To do that, Po1s0n1vy likely so sent GET and POST requests to the server ...and what's the account would be the most targeted in first place by default ? Yes, it's `admin`.

"A brute force attack can manifest itself in many different ways, but primarily consists in an attacker configuring predetermined values, making requests to a server using those values, and then analyzing the response. For the sake of efficiency, an attacker may use a dictionary attack (with or without mutations) or a traditional brute-force attack (with given classes of characters e.g.: alphanumeric, special, case (in)sensitive). Considering a given method, number of tries, efficiency of the system which conducts the attack, and estimated efficiency of the system which is attacked the attacker is able to calculate approximately how long it will take to submit all chosen predetermined values." - OWASP

Let's dive into the event with the SPL search:
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http src_ip=23.22.63.114 OR src_ip=40.80.148.42 AND "admin"
`spog`
```
Well, only 458 events, let's start investigating. 

We found something !

```

Let's see which IP Address who do this nasty stuffs
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=stream:http "admin" src_content=username*
|table src_ip dest_ip
|stats count by src_ip dest_ip
```
![pic6](/assets/images/botsv1/pic6.png)

**ANSWER: 23.22.63.114**

#### Question 9 (109): What is the name of the executable uploaded by Po1s0n1vy? Please include file extension. (For example, "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico")

Based on previous SPL searched, we are not only know what's the IP Address was using to brute force attack the website, we also know imreallynotbatman.com was running on Microsoft-IIS version 8.5. 
```log
dest_header
HTTP/1.1 303 See other\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nLocation: http://imreallynotbatman.com/joomla/administrator/index.php\r\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\r\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.38\r\nDate: Wed, 10 Aug 2016 21:46:15 GMT\r\nConnection: close\r\nContent-Length: 182\r\n\r\n
```
What do you think when you get that information ? Yub, the excutable uploaded by Po1s0n1vy could be any `.exe` or `.ps1` file. Let search using the clue we are having. 
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* *.exe OR *.ps1
`spog`
```

We got those field - value that we could looking into.
```log
category        Unrated
                W32/Swrort.C!tr
```
```log
file_name       cmd.exe
                3791.exe
                ZAk5LbgaGf.exe
                le_check_v3.exe
                shtml.exe
```
Did some researches, i got this information: 
"W32/Swrort.C!tr is classified as a Trojan.
Trojan has the capabilities to remote access connection handling, perform Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed DoS (DDoS), capture keyboard inputs, delete file or object, or terminate process.
The Fortinet Anti-Virus Analyst Team is currently in the process of creating a detailed description for this virus." - Fortiguard

So let's start with that IoC first.
```sql
index="botsv1" sourcetype=fortigate_* category="W32/Swrort.C!tr"
``` 
We got only 1 event from that search
```log
Aug 10 15:52:45 192.168.250.1 date=2016-08-10 time=15:52:45 devname=gotham-fortigate devid=FGT60D4614044725 logid=0211008193 type=utm subtype=virus eventtype=infected level=notice vd="root" msg="File is infected." action=monitored service=HTTP sessionid=923537 srcip=40.80.148.42 dstip=192.168.250.70 srcport=49490 dstport=80 dstintf="internal3" policyid=26 proto=6 direction=outgoing filename="3791.exe" quarskip=No-skip virus="W32/Swrort.C!tr" dtype="Virus" ref="http://www.fortinet.com/ve?vn=W32%2FSwrort.C%21tr" virusid=1706341 url="http://imreallynotbatman.com/joomla/administrator/index.php" profile="Honeypot-Access" user="" agent="Mozilla/5.0" analyticscksum="ec78c938d8453739ca2a370b9c275971ec46caf6e479de2b2d04e97cc47fa45d" analyticssubmit=false crscore=50 crlevel=critical
```
We got :
- `srcip=40.80.148.42` which is belong to Po1s0n1vy's infrastructure
- `dstip=192.168.250.70` which is imreallynotbatman.com
- `filename="3791.exe" ` which is excutable file
- `dtype="Virus"`
- `analyticscksum="ec78c938d8453739ca2a370b9c275971ec46caf6e479de2b2d04e97cc47fa45d"` which file checksum, i will do OSINT base on that SHA256.

![pic7](/assets/images/botsv1/pic7.png)
_Damn!_

**ANSWER: 3791.exe**

#### Question 10 (110): What is the MD5 hash of the executable uploaded?
Based on previous triaged, we also got this MD5 hash. 

![pic8](/assets/images/botsv1/pic8.png)

**ANSWER: aae3f5a29935e6abcc2c2754d12a9af0**
