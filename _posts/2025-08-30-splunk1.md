Since i'm implenting SIEM enviroment for clients, so i think, well, it good to deploy my own SIEM enviroment for home lab for practicing, also testing before applying concept to prod enviroment, do PoC and so on. 

Since in enterprise network, we'll facing multiple data sources, also, come from widely known vendors, so my new home lab project trying to replicate it as much as possible.
