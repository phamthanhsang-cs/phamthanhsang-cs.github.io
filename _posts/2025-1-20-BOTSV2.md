# Introduction  
Hi Splunkers! Welcome back to my **Boss of the SOC (BOTS)** series on my blog.

If you have'nt read my [BOTSv1 Write-ups](https://phamthanhsang-cs.github.io/posts/BOTSV1/) yet, please take a look to have a understand about [Boss of the SOC - Blue team CTF Challenge made by Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/what-you-need-to-know-about-boss-of-the-soc.html), i appreciate that a lot !

### About Boss of the SOC version 2
In [BOTSv1 Write-ups](https://phamthanhsang-cs.github.io/posts/BOTSV1/), we solved various question as an Alice Bluebird's cybersecurity analyst to help Wayne Enterprise indentify root cause of their suffered digital world including 

# Enviroment setup
- **Pre-requisites:** Participating in Boss of the SOC (BOTS) is easier than ever, thanks to it's availability on various platforms:
  - [Splunk Officially](https://bots.splunk.com/login?redirect=/)
  - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
  - [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)

# Walkthrough 
*However, all the walkthroughs in this guide are based on **self-hosted setup**, including more or less what's CTF scoreboard look like. If you'd like to follow along or set up your own CTF environment, check out this [detailed post](https://phamthanhsang-cs.github.io/posts/BOTS-setup/) where we’ll walk through everything step-by-step together, thank you.*

- **Dataset Information:** For this walkthrough, I’m using the complete dataset from BOTSv2 which is heavier than BOTs1 5x times ~ 16.4 GB. that's crazy, we definitely gonna have a fun time together to explore and analyze through those logs.   

### Let's Splunking !
Same as BOTsv1. before deep diving into answer BOTS questions, i would like to prepare some SPL searches to help us easier to hunting threats: 
- First is `|metadata index="botsv1" type=sourcetypes | stats values(sourcetype)`, the following SPL command helps me quickly identify the sourcetypes present in the dataset. This gives me a clear idea of the types of data we should focus on during investigation:
- The second one is `|metasearch index="botsv1" sourcetype=<specific_sourcetype> <keyword>`.
- The third one is `|fieldsummary` with [marcro](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchmacro) setup. My search will look like this:

```sql
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
```
*And i'd set this search with marcro named `spog` (single pane of glass), you will see why those searches helped me so much in this walkthrough.*
