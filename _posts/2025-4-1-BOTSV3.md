# Introduction

Hi Splunkers! Welcome back to my **Boss of the SOC (BOTS)** series on my blog.

If you haven’t read my previous [BOTSv1 Write-ups](https://phamthanhsang-cs.site/posts/BOTSV1/) and [BOTSv2 Write-ups](https://phamthanhsang-cs.site/posts/BOTSV2/) yet, I highly recommend checking them out first. They’ll give you a solid understanding of [Boss of the SOC - the Blue Team CTF Challenge created by Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/what-you-need-to-know-about-boss-of-the-soc.html). I’d really appreciate it!


### About Boss of the SOC Version 3

**Boss of the SOC Version 3** is the latest publicly available BOTS CTF Challenge created by Splunk. In this version, we step into the shoes of **Alice Bluebird** - a quirky cybersecurity analyst to help organizations uncover the root causes of their digital chaos.

In the previous version (BOTSv2), we helped **Frothly**, a fictional craft beer company, detect hidden threats in their environment. From insiders using Tor to hide their activities, to external APTs attempting to exfiltrate intellectual property - it was intense.

Now, in BOTSv3, Frothly has grown rapidly and their traditional infrastructure can no longer keep up. As part of their technological evolution, they’ve migrated their environment to the cloud — utilizing both **AWS** and **Azure** for different business needs.

But as we know, for hackers, there’s nowhere to hide. As security analysts, it’s our job to help Frothly identify suspicious activity and trace the **root cause of digital chaos** in their expanded cloud infrastructure.

> **Fun Fact about my Boss of the SOC series:**  
> BOTSv3 was actually the **first version I completed**, even before versions 1 and 2!  
> It all started back in **April 2024**, with a Splunk instance running on a Linux VM inside my VirtualBox.  
> Revisiting this version now not only helps **refresh the knowledge** I’ve gained, but also sharpens the **analytical skills** I’ve developed since then.

# Environment Setup

- **Pre-requisites:**  
  Participating in **Boss of the SOC (BOTS)** is easier than ever thanks to its availability on various platforms:
  - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
  - [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)

  Unfortunately, **Boss of the SOC v3** doesn’t appear on Splunk’s official website, but they have made the dataset [public on GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3) for anyone who wants to download it and give it a try.

  > *However, all walkthroughs in this guide are based on a **self-hosted setup**, including an approximation of what the CTF scoreboard looks like.*
  > *If you'd like to follow along or set up your own environment, check out this [detailed setup guide](https://phamthanhsang-cs.github.io/posts/BOTS-setup/) where we walk through everything step-by-step. Thanks!*

- **Dataset Information:**  
  Unlike BOTSv1 and BOTSv2, the third version only includes a **pre-indexed dataset** (~320MB), with a total of around **2 million events**.

# Walkthrough 
### Let's Splunking !
Same as both previous versions. before deep diving into answer BOTS questions, i would like to prepare some SPL searches to help us easier to hunting threats: 
- First is `|metadata index="botsv1" type=sourcetypes | stats values(sourcetype)`, the following SPL command helps me quickly identify the sourcetypes present in the dataset. This gives me a clear idea of the types of data we should focus on during investigation:
- The second one is `|metasearch index="botsv1" sourcetype=<specific_sourcetype> <keyword>`.
- The third one is `|fieldsummary` with [marcro](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Searchmacro) setup. My search will look like this:

```sql
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
```
*And i'd set this search with marcro named `spog` (single pane of glass), you will see why those searches helped me so much in this walkthrough.*

_WELCOME BACK TO MY BOSS OF THE SOC SERIES_

### Series 200

#### Question 1 (200): List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly's AWS environment? Answer guidance: Comma separated without spaces, in alphabetical order. (Example: ajackson,mjones,tmiller)

> And like with the previous versions, I always recommend spending a little time to get a bird's-eye view of the `index` and its associated `sourcetypes` before jumping into the logs.  
> This will give you a better understanding of the data and where to begin your hunt.
>
> ```sql
> | metadata index=botsv3 type=sourcetypes 
> | stats values(sourcetype)
> ```

Before diving into the logs, it's important to understand a few foundational concepts and services in the world-leading cloud computing platform — **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

> I’m a big fan of F1 racing, and it’s fascinating that AWS is a key partner of the competition.  
> They provide a service called **F1® Insights**, transforming a traditional sport into a data-driven one. 

When discussing cloud computing, people often think of most common services like:

- **Compute** (e.g., EC2 for AWS, Azure Virtual Machines, OCI VMs for Oracle)
- **Storage** (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
- **Serverless** (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)

For this question, we're focusing on **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** - like **AWS IAM** or **Microsoft Entra ID** - to track which users accessed services.


**High-Level Overview of Relevant AWS Services:**

**Logging & Activity Tracking**
- **`aws:cloudtrail`**: Records API activity and management events.  
   *Primary service for auditing user activity (e.g., starting EC2 instances, creating S3 buckets).*

**Monitoring & Alerts**
- **`aws:cloudwatch`**: Monitors resources/applications, collects metrics, sets alarms, and builds dashboards.
- **`aws:cloudwatchlogs`**: Core log storage backend for services like EC2, Lambda, Route53.
- **`aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow`**: Captures IP traffic to/from network interfaces in your **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud).
- **`aws:cloudwatch:guardduty`**: Threat detection using ML to identify and alert on suspicious activity.

**Configuration & Compliance**
- **`aws:config:rule`**: Continuously checks resources against compliance rules (e.g., tagging, encryption, instance types).

**Storage & Access**
- **`aws:s3:accesslogs`**: Provides detailed records of requests to S3 buckets.

**Load Balancing**
- **`aws:elb:accesslogs`**: Tracks all traffic sent to Elastic Load Balancers (ELB).

**Relational Databases (RDS)**
- **`aws:rds:audit`**: Tracks database activities for engines like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle.
- **`aws:rds:error`**: Logs engine errors for RDS services.

**Metadata**
- **`aws:description`**: Contains descriptive metadata about various AWS services (e.g., names, tags, IDs).

This understanding will help guide our log searches, especially focusing on **CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch** logs to identify IAM users and their interactions with AWS services.

The **CloudTrail** service records most user activity, and AWS provides detailed documentation about the fields used in these API tracking logs, which is extremely helpful.

[CloudTrail record contents for management, data, and network activity events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.html)

![pic3](assets/images/botsv3/pic3.png)

This information gives us a clear idea of where to begin when analyzing the logs.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail AND eventType=AwsConsoleSignIn
```

Only 4 events were returned. Below is an example of one of these logs:

```json
{
  "requestParameters": null,
  "additionalEventData": {
    "MobileVersion": "No",
    "MFAUsed": "No",
    "LoginTo": "https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?state=hashArgs%23&isauthcode=true"
  },
  "eventTime": "2018-08-20T15:04:44Z",
  "eventID": "6ae589cc-9b68-4a08-a3c2-c29c9cd59b9b",
  "eventVersion": "1.05",
  "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
  "eventType": "AwsConsoleSignIn",
  "eventSource": "signin.amazonaws.com",
  "userIdentity": {
    "principalId": "AIDAJUFKXZ44LV4EN4MGK",
    "arn": "arn:aws:iam::622676721278:user/bstoll",
    "type": "IAMUser",
    "userName": "bstoll",
    "accountId": "622676721278"
  },
  "eventName": "ConsoleLogin",
  "recipientAccountId": "622676721278",
  "responseElements": {
    "ConsoleLogin": "Success"
  },
  "sourceIPAddress": "107.77.212.175",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.99 Safari/537.36"
}
```

The `userIdentity` field contains useful information we can extract to identify all IAM users active in Frothly’s AWS environment:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | spath "userIdentity.type" | search "userIdentity.type"=IAMUser| spath "userIdentity.userName" 
|table userIdentity.userName userIdentity.type
|stats count by userIdentity.userName userIdentity.type
|sort - userIdentity.userName
```

![pic4](assets/images/botsv3/pic4.png)

There were four users identified: `bstoll,btun,splunk_access,web_admin`.

> ANSWER: `bstoll,btun,splunk_access,web_admin`
{: .prompt-info }

#### Question 2 (201): What field would you use to alert that AWS API activity have occurred without MFA (multi-factor authentication)? Answer guidance: Provide the full JSON path. (Example: iceCream.flavors.traditional)

This question isn’t just about filling in the blank with the correct answer - it’s more about understanding how to **optimize** the approach and **choose the right fields** to make your detection logic effective. In this case, we’ll gradually narrow down events in CloudTrail to find a useful field for alerting.

The idea is to gather as many **relevant** logs as possible - the more targeted and consistent the field, the more effective and noise-free your alert will be.

I will filter only for `eventType=AwsApiCall` and then run a bird’s eye view using the `spog` macro (or similar approach) to audit the fields. We’re specifically looking for fields that:
- Appear in the logs.
- Have 3 or fewer unique values (easy to evaluate conditions).
- Are related to **MFA** (multi-factor authentication).

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail eventType=AwsApiCall
|search *mfa*
|fieldsummary
|fields field values
|rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
|mvexpand value
|stats dc(value) as value_count values(value) as values by field
|where value_count <= 3
```

![pic5](assets/images/botsv3/pic5.png)
_The search results would look like thiThe search results above show various fields; we're looking for those relevant to MFA with few value variations_

Among the results, a promising field appeared: `userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated` - This field consistently reflects whether an AWS API activity was authenticated using MFA.

![pic6](assets/images/botsv3/pic6.png)

Upon deeper inspection, this field is populated in various eventName and eventSource combinations, making it ideal for a wide coverage alert that detects AWS API activity without MFA.

> ANSWER: `userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated`
{: .prompt-info }

#### Question 3 (202): What is the processor number used on the web servers? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation. (Example: The processor number for Intel Core i7-8650U is i7-8650U.)

Going back to the `metadata` of sourcetypes, there was only one sourcetype relevant to this type of question: `hardware`. Querying this sourcetype returned only 3 events, all containing the same logs.

```sql
index=botsv2 sourcetype=hardware
```

![pic8](assets/images/botsv3/pic8.png)
_But is this really the correct answer ?_

To confirm, I looked up the host associated with the hardware logs: `gacrux.i-09cbc261e84259b54` - and checked if it was truly a web server.

```sql
|metasearch index=botsv3 sourcetype=* host="gacrux.i-09cbc261e84259b54"
|table sourcetype
|stats count by sourcetype
```

The result returned 45 sourcetypes, and among them was one that clearly indicated the host was a web server: `apache_error` (with 7 events).

Diving into that sourcetype confirmed the server was running Apache/2.2.34.

#### Question 4 (203): Bud accidentally makes an S3 bucket publicly accessible. What is the event ID of the API call that enabled public access? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation.

This seems to mark the beginning of a serious security incident. It reminds me of a real case at my previous company, where an **AWS secret key** was accidentally exposed. A threat actor discovered it, gained access to our cloud environment, deployed crypto miners, and caused **significant financial loss.**

In this scenario, public access to an S3 bucket was likely the attacker's entry point into Frothly’s AWS environment.

In earlier questions, we saw that almost all services had **MFA disabled**. So I started by filtering CloudTrail logs for `eventSource=s3.amazonaws.com` where MFA was not used:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail 
AND userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated=false AND eventSource=s3.amazonaws.com
```

![pic10](/assets/images/botsv3/pic10.png)

I got 15 unique eventName results. I then referred to [AWS S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html) which explained that S3 bucket permissions are controlled through ACLs. The `PutBucketAcl` API is used to change these permissions.

Only two events matched `PutBucketAcl`, so I focused on those:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail 
AND userIdentity.sessionContext.attributes.mfaAuthenticated=false AND eventSource=s3.amazonaws.com AND eventName=PutBucketAcl
```

```json

```

Oh well ! Bud granted READ and WRITE access to `AllUsers`, meaning anyone on the internet could access this bucket:

```json
          {
            "Grantee": {
              "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers",
              "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance",
              "xsi:type": "Group"
            },
            "Permission": "READ"
          }
          {
            "Grantee": {
              "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers",
              "xmlns:xsi": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance",
              "xsi:type": "Group"
            },
            "Permission": "WRITE"
          }
```

How about the second one ?

In this second event, Bud appears to have tried fixing his mistake by removing public access and only assigning permissions to internal groups. Unfortunately, it was too late. There was a 56-minute window between the first and second event - more than enough time for an attacker to gain a foothold.

Worse still, the bucket in question was `frothlywebcode`, which could contain sensitive source code or configurations. An attacker could exploit this in unpredictable and damaging ways.

#### Question 5 (204): What is the name of the S3 bucket that was made publicly accessible?

I won't explain anything in this following question ! We've seem like confirm the initial access vector from the adversary.

#### Question 6 (205): What is the name of the text file that was successfully uploaded into the S3 bucket while it was publicly accessible? Answer guidance: Provide just the file name and extension, not the full path. (Example: filename.docx instead of /mylogs/web/filename.docx)

Now that we’ve built the timeline, let’s dive into some timeline analysis.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype="aws:s3:accesslogs" earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46" AND latest="08/20/2018:20:57:54" AND bucket_name=frothlywebcode
|reverse
```
After extracting some key fields, we can see a few interesting events logged in the frothlywebcode S3 bucket.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype="aws:s3:accesslogs" earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46" AND latest="08/20/2018:20:57:54" AND bucket_name=frothlywebcode
|reverse
|table _time remote_ip user_agent action http_method operation request_uri object_size
```

We already know that the IP `107.77.212.175` belongs to `bstoll` who was accidentally misconfiged Frothy's private bucket, so let’s focus on the other entries.

From the logs:
- IP `52.66.146.128` uploaded a text file named `OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt`
- IP `35.182.246.222` uploaded a zipped file named `frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz`, which is about 3 MB in size

After these uploads, we also see some enumeration activity in the logs:

![pic12](assets/images/botsv3/pic12.png)

Toward the end of the timeline, the IP that uploaded the zipped file (`35.182.246.222`) appears to enumerate the entire S3 bucket:

![pic13](assets/images/botsv3/pic13.png)

It looks like the text file `OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt` was uploaded as a warning to Frothly about their bucket being publicly accessible. On the other hand, the zipped file seems more suspicious and worth further investigation.

**Victim**
- `"bucketName": "frothlywebcode"`

**Possible Malicious contents**
- `52.66.146.128` 
- `35.182.246.222`
- `OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt`
- `frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz`


> ANSWER: `OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt`
{: .prompt-info}

#### Question 7 (206): What is the size (in megabytes) of the .tar.gz file that was successfully uploaded into the S3 bucket while it was publicly accessible? Answer guidance: Round to two decimal places without the unit of measure. Use 1024 for the byte conversion. Use a period (not a comma) as the radix character.

This question is straightforward, so we won’t go into too much detail here. We'll dig deeper into the threat actor’s TTPs in the next questions.

To calculate the size of the uploaded file, and based on previous question, we can use the following Splunk query, the key was using `round`:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype="aws:s3:accesslogs" earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46" latest="08/20/2018:20:57:54" bucket_name=frothlywebcode remote_ip!=107.77.212.175 AND http_method=PUT
|reverse
|eval object_size_MB=round(object_size/1024/1024, 2)
|table _time remote_ip user_agent action http_method operation request_uri object_size object_size_MB
```

![pic14](assets/images/botsv3/pic14.png)
_From the results, the file `frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz` had a size of 2.93 MB_

> ANSWER: `2.93`
{: .prompt-info}

#### Question 8 (208): A Frothly endpoint exhibits signs of coin mining activity. What is the name of the first process to reach 100 percent CPU processor utilization time from this activity on this endpoint? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation.

This question was more difficult to answer due to the small size and lack of contextual depth in the BOTSv3 dataset. Unlike BOTSv2's, even "attack-only" dataset has the size about 3.2 GB, correlating between multiple data sources here is more limited. Nevertheless, we’ll work with what’s available.

In the previous question, we identified several suspicious files (`OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt`, `frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz`) across multiple endpoints. To begin the investigation, I ran the following search:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=* AND sourcetype!=aws:s3:accesslogs AND earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46" 
AND (*OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt* OR *frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz*)
|reverse
```
This search revealed six endpoints interacting with suspicious files:

- BSTOLL-L - Source types: `xmlwineventlog`, `wineventlog`
- `gacrux.i-09cbc261e84259b54` - Apache web server
- Two more similar EC2 instances - Source type: c`loud-init-output`
- `mars.i-08e52f8b5a034012d` - Source types: `osquery:results`, `bash_history`
- `console.us.code42.com` - Possibly Code42 security monitoring/assessment platform

![pic15](assets/images/botsv3/pic15.png)

Logs from Code42 clearly show BudStoll downloading and opening the file using `chrome.exe`:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=* AND sourcetype!=aws:s3:accesslogs AND earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46" 
AND (*OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt* OR *frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz*)

}
```

This a strong indicator that BudStoll had downloaded file and opened it, actived process `chrome.exe`.

Next was those 3 Web Server, minimal events from these hosts. However, logs show downloads from s3://frothlywebcode, indicating this is part of Frothly’s internal CI/CD deployment infrastructure. The malicious file was also fetched during the setup, but there's no sign it was executed here.

Last but not least, the last host, the `bash_history` and `osquery:results` logs suggest this instance was used for scripting and automation, including uploading the file:.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=* AND sourcetype!=aws:s3:accesslogs AND earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46" 
AND (*OPEN_BUCKET_PLEASE_FIX.txt* OR *frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz*)

python /home/ec2-user/tools/s3-upload.py --bucket frothlywebcode --file frothly_web_memcaced.tar.gz --folder ‘’ --target frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz <---- Logs from bash_history
```

Despite limited indicators of compromise (IOCs) on BSTOLL-L, this endpoint is our strongest lead based on:
- The user (BudStoll) downloading and opening the file
- Associated Windows event logs being available

To detect coin mining activity, I focused on performance monitoring logs. Three relevant sourcetypes surfaced:
- top
- cpu
- PerfmonMk:Process

Out of these, `PerfmonMk:Process` is particularly important—it logs CPU usage per process and was only seen from `BSTOLL-L`.

Using `PerfmonMk:Process`, I looked for the first process that spiked to 100% CPU usage. After sorting the data chronologically, the first process to hit this threshold was revealed.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype="PerfmonMk:Process" AND process_cpu_used_percent=100 AND earliest="08/20/2018:20:01:46"
|reverse
|table _time process_name ID_Process
```

![pic16](assets/images/botsv3/pic16.png)

A bunch of chrome processes reach 100% cpu usage, start with `chrome#5`

Trace back with the process id of 3400.

![pic17](assets/images/botsv3/pic17.png)

There were not much indicators that we could pull out from the sourcetypes.

#### Question 9 (209): When a Frothly web server EC2 instance is launched via auto scaling, it performs automated configuration tasks after the instance starts. How many packages and dependent packages are installed by the cloud initialization script? Answer guidance: Provide the number of installed packages then number of dependent packages, comma separated without spaces.

In earlier steps, we identified that three Frothly web servers were involved in deploying and possibly executing a suspicious payload (`frothly_html_memcached.tar.gz`). During startup, these EC2 instances run a cloud initialization script, which installs various packages necessary for the web server environment.

To find the exact number of installed packages, I reviewed the logs from the relevant cloud-init output. Here's a snippet of the relevant transaction summary:

#### Question 10 (210): What is the short hostname of the only Frothly endpoint to actually mine Monero cryptocurrency? (Example: ahamilton instead of ahamilton.mycompany.com)

This question directly follows the CPU-based analysis from Question 8. As previously established, the only endpoint to run `chrome.exe` and hit 100% CPU usage was: `BSTOLL-L` - BudStoll's endpoint.

This matches the behavior of Monero mining, and no other endpoint demonstrated similar behavior. But question revealed several questions:
- Why CPU but not GPU or even Asics, because that's Monero.
- A tons of chrome processes use for crypto mining but no indicator of compromise in host machine really triggerd an alert about browser-based crypto mining
- Assume that `.txt` extracted suspicious zipped contain information of

#### Mid-Series Recap

Before continuing this series, let’s take a moment to slow down and chain together what we've uncovered so far.

I have to admit, I got a bit lost in the previous questions. It became difficult to map some of the activities to the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain due to the lack of context. Here's a breakdown of what we observed:

- The adversary gained a foothold in the Frothly environment via a publicly exposed S3 bucket.
- They injected a malicious ZIP file into the bucket.
- A web server fetched the contents of the bucket through an automated script (`s3update.py`). However, there was no clear evidence that the web server actually executed the contents of the ZIP.
- Bud Stoll downloaded and opened the file, which had a `.txt` extension.
- There was no obvious malicious execution on `BSTOLL-L` (possibly Bud Stoll's laptop).
- Despite that, the endpoint showed signs of cryptojacking-specifically, multiple `chrome.exe` processes consuming 100% CPU.

**Unanswered Questions**

There are several aspects I couldn’t make sense of:

- How could a `.txt` file lead to a cryptojacking incident? There was no associated process or command line activity (as seen in the timeline) to indicate execution.
- How did a legitimate process like `chrome.exe` hit 100% CPU? There were no signs of process injection, hollowing, or hijacking.

At this point, the only clear indicator of compromise was the malicious ZIP file (Initial Access). Without evidence of execution, it was hard to move forward meaningfully. Simply finding flags to answer questions doesn’t help us *learn* anything.

After spent several hours researching and finally came across something that blew my mind, and potentially unlocks the whole series.

Let’s talk briefly about cryptocurrency:

- **Bitcoin** is the most well-known cryptocurrency. We’ve all seen giant mining farms built with custom hardware-**ASICs**-designed for nothing but complex math. They're powerful but expensive and have no resale value once obsolete.
- Bitcoin’s blockchain ledger is also public, you can trace who sent what to whom and how much.

In contrast:

- **Monero (XMR)** is a **privacy-focused** cryptocurrency. It can be mined efficiently using **CPUs**, and transactions are untraceable.
- Monero mining happens in two primary ways:
  1. Installing dedicated software to run mining operations.
  2. **Browser-based mining**, users visit a website and unknowingly contribute CPU resources via JavaScript APIs. Once they leave the site, mining stops.

**Coinhive**

One of the most infamous browser-based mining platforms was **Coinhive**, popular around 2017-2018.

Coinhive was marketed as a **win-win** model:
- Website owners could earn revenue from visitors **without ads**.
- Visitors contributed a small amount of CPU power (often throttled) and enjoyed an ad-free experience.

Unfortunately, adversaries **abused** this model:
- They embedded Coinhive scripts **without CPU throttling**, **without notice**, and **without user consent**, resulting in cryptojacking.

**Connecting the kill-chain**

This revelation tied a lot of loose ends together:

- The `.txt` file Bud Stoll opened may have contained an embedded **malicious link** or **hidden redirection**.
- Once opened, it may have triggered the browser (`chrome.exe`) to **visit a cryptojacking website** running Coinhive or a similar script.
- That's why `chrome.exe` spiked to 100% CPU—without any clear malware or injected payload.

**Useful Resources**

#### Question 11 (211): How many cryptocurrency mining destinations are visited by Frothly endpoints?
Since we've already identified that `chrome.ex`e is the process responsible for cryptomining activity, and we know Bud Stoll’s computer was compromised via drive-by cryptojacking, the next step is to determine which websites he visited that could have triggered the attack.

First, I traced all the websites Bud Stoll accessed during the infection window — the timeframe between the first and last appearance of `chrome.exe` consuming 100% CPU:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=wineventlog host="BSTOLL-L" *chrome* Outbound 
earliest="08/20/2018:20:37:50" latest="08/20/2018:21:04:11"
AND (Destination_Port=443 OR Destination_Port=80)
|dedup Destination_Address
|table Destination_Address
```

![pic18](/assets/images/botsv3/pic18.png)
_42 distinct IP addresses that Bud’s machine communicated with during that period._

To get more context, I correlated this data with DNS queries to identify actual domain names. This query pulled DNS resolutions linked to the identified destination IPs.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:dns 
[search index=botsv3 sourcetype=wineventlog host="BSTOLL-L" *chrome* Outbound 
earliest="08/20/2018:20:37:50" latest="08/20/2018:21:04:11"
AND (Destination_Port=443 OR Destination_Port=80)
|dedup Destination_Address
|fields Destination_Address 
|rename Destination_Address as host_addr{}
|format
]
|table query{}
|stats count by query{}
```

Surprisingly, one of the resolved domains was `coinhive.com` - a well-known browser-based Monero mining platform.

![pic19](assets/images/botsv3/pic19.png)

Wanting to see how widespread this was, I broadened the search across all Frothly endpoints, removing the time constraint and filtering for any connection to `coinhive.com`.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:dns 
[search index=botsv3 sourcetype=wineventlog host=* *chrome* Outbound 
AND (Destination_Port=443 OR Destination_Port=80)
|dedup Destination_Address
|fields Destination_Address 
|rename Destination_Address as host_addr{}
|format
]
AND *coinhive.com
|table query{}
|stats count by query{}
```

![pic20](assets/images/botsv3/pic20.png)

This revealed that six distinct Coinhive-related domains were visited by Frothly endpoints, there were 2 endpoints contacted to those domain:
- BSTOLL-L
- MKRAEUS-L

**Victim**
- BSTOLL-L
- MKRAEUS-L

**Malicous Contents**
- coinhive.com - 104.20.209.59
- ws001.coinhive.com - 217.182.164.14
- ws005.coinhive.com - 37.187.165.41
- ws011.coinhive.com - 37.187.166.108

- ws019.coinhive.com - 37.187.167.47

#### Question 12 (212): Using Splunk's event order functions, what is the first seen signature ID of the coin miner threat according to Frothly's Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) data?

Since there were no obvious indicators carried over from previous questions, I started with a broad search in the EDR platform for any events mentioning coin mining activity. This returned 46 events:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=symantec* AND *coin*
|reverse
|table _time user Host_Name Remote_Host_IP Intrusion_URL file_name Event_Description
|rename user as victim, Host_Name as victim_host, Remote_Host_IP as malicous_ip
```

The earliest relevant log:

```bash

```

Interestingly, the IP address blocked for the JavaScript Coinminer attack is tied to Frothly’s own web infrastructure, specifically an AWS Elastic Load Balancer. All three of Frothly's web servers were redundantly configured and fetched a malicious zip file at some earlier stage.

Unfortunately, despite this connection, I could not find a `.js` file or any conclusive artifacts proving that the zipped contents led to direct cryptojacking via JavaScript. Still, the first seen signature ID remains clear.

#### Question 13 (213): According to Symantec's website, what is the severity of this specific coin miner threat?	

This is a follow-up to Question 12. The severity rating for this signature ID (30358) is listed on Broadcom's Security Center:

#### Question 14 (214): What is the short hostname of the only Frothly endpoint to show evidence of defeating the cryptocurrency threat? (Example: ahamilton instead of ahamilton.mycompany.com)

All alerts related to the coin miner activity—including those indicating successful blocking-were observed on a single endpoint: `BTUN-L`, which belongs to Billy Tun.

> ANSWER: `BTUN-L`
{: .prompt-info }

#### Question 15 (215): What is the FQDN of the endpoint that is running a different Windows operating system edition than the others?

This question feels like a classic CTF-style prompt, possibly with some hidden hints. From experience in previous Boss of the SOC (BOTS) scenarios, we know that the `WinHostMon` sourcetype includes detailed Windows host metadata.

To start, I searched for all host information that contains OS data:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinHostMon (OS AND *Win*)
```

![pic23](assets/images/botsv3/pic23.png)

Since I wanted a higher-level summary, I used the Bird's Eye View approach to see which fields might reveal OS version data:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinHostMon (OS AND *Win*)
| fieldsummary 
| fields field values value 
| rex field=values max_match=0 "\"value\":\"(?<value>[^\"]+)\""
| fields field value
| where isnotnull(value)
```

![pic24](assets/images/botsv3/pic24.png)

As expected, there was a field that reliably includes OS details. Using a focused query, I filtered by host and OS:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinHostMon (OS AND *Win*)
|table OS host 
|stats count by OS host
```
Output:

| OS                              | host      | count |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise | BSTOLL-L  | 30    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | ABUNGST-L | 16    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | BGIST-L   | 23    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | BTUN-L    | 29    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | FYODOR-L  | 23    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | JWORTOS-L | 30    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | MKRAEUS-L | 25    |
| Microsoft Windows 10 Pro        | PCERF-L   | 28    |

From the output, it's clear that only one machine - `BSTOLL-L` is running Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise, while all others are using the Pro edition:

To find the FQDN of `BSTOLL-L`, I queried the `wineventlog` sourcetype using common logon Event Codes (4624 for successful logon, 4625 for failure):

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=wineventlog AND host=BSTOLL-L AND EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625
```

```log

#### Question 16 (216): According to the Cisco NVM flow logs, for how many seconds does the endpoint generate Monero cryptocurrency? Answer guidance: Round to the nearest second without the unit of measure.
We previously identified that some Frothly endpoints had accessed coinhive.com, a well-known browser-based Monero mining service often abused by attackers. It’s reasonable to analyze how long an affected user might have unknowingly donated CPU resources to this malicious site.

**Understanding the Log Source**
The question points us to Cisco NVM (Network Visibility Module) flow logs. According to Cisco’s documentation - [Install and Configure Cisco Network Visi](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/200600-Install-and-Configure-Cisco-Network-Visi.html#anc19), NVM data can be forwarded to a Syslog server, which matches our environment.

We had already collected Coinhive-related IP addresses from a previous question:
- coinhive.com - 104.20.209.59
- ws001.coinhive.com - 217.182.164.14
- ws005.coinhive.com - 37.187.165.41
- ws011.coinhive.com - 37.187.166.108
- ws014.coinhive.com - 37.187.167.21
- ws019.coinhive.com - 37.187.167.47

Using these, i could run the following Splunk query to identify NVM flow logs related to Coinhive access:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=syslog source=cisconvmflowdata 
AND (104.20.209.59 OR 217.182.164.14 OR 37.187.165.41 OR 37.187.166.108 OR 37.187.167.21 OR 37.187.167.47)
|reverse 
```

_This search returned five relevant events_

From these fields, we can determine the start and end time of Bud Stoll's connection to the mining domain by utilize 2 field: `fst` for start time and `fet` for the end time.

Now i could calculate the full duration across all matching logs:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=syslog source=cisconvmflowdata 
AND (104.20.209.59 OR 217.182.164.14 OR 37.187.165.41 OR 37.187.166.108 OR 37.187.167.21 OR 37.187.167.47)
|stats min(fss) as first_time max(fes) as last_time
|eval duration_seconds = last_time - first_time
|eval duration_human = tostring(duration_seconds, "duration")
```

![pic27](assets/images/botsv3/pic27.png)

That means Bud Stoll’s machine was interacting with Coinhive infrastructure for approximately 1666 seconds (~27.8 minutes).

> ANSWER: `1666`
{: .prompt-info }

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT**
While 30 minutes may not seem long, it’s significant enough for cryptojacking to occur, especially given the browser (Chrome) was involved. Earlier evidence also showed three Frothly websites were compromised and redirected users to brewertalk.com, which likely hosted the mining script.

Bud Stoll may have been investigating or testing this malicious `.txt` file we saw in earlier questions, ultimately leading him to Coinhive-linked domain, intentionally or unintentionally donating CPU cycles to the attacker.

#### Question 17 (217): What kind of Splunk visualization was in the first file attachment that Bud emails to Frothly employees to illustrate the coin miner issue? Answer guidance: Two words. (Example: choropleth map)

This question reinforces the hypothesis from the previous challenge - Bud Stoll detected suspicious activity inside Frothly’s environment and initiated an investigation, eventually alerting the company about a coin miner issue.

To analyze Bud’s email activity, we focus on the `stream:smtp` sourcetype. If you're familiar with earlier Boss of the SOC (v1 and v2), this sourcetype is a treasure trove for email-related data.

We want to find emails sent by Bud Stoll that contain file attachments:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:smtp 
|spath sender_alias
|search sender_alias="Bud Stoll"
AND attach_filename{}!=""
|reverse
```

![pic28](assets/images/botsv3/pic28.png)

Only four events were returned. Manual inspection is easy in this case. One email stood out-it was addressed to: `allhands <allhands@froth.ly>`

This indicates a broadcast to all Frothly members and that email also included two JPEG attachments:
- `image002.jpg`  
- `image003.jpg`

By reviewing Email Conversation, i found something interested

Here’s the extracted email thread:

Hey Frothlies!

I just added some great improvements to brewertalk.com to better handle for=
um threads and allow for posts of multi-media kinds of files rather than ju=
st photos. And it's all running in our new swanky AWS environment ("the clo=
ud" for those of you not sure what that is!) I think you'll be impressed en=
ough to maybe buy me a beer!  Let me know.

The thread reveals how Bud identified the cryptojacking activity. He observed CPU spikes on his Chrome browser and created a Splunk chart to show the impact.

But how to extract the attachment and see whats in it ? 

To examine the image contents, we look at the `content` field in the email logs. It contains embedded base64-encoded files. For example:

```log
     Content-Type: image/jpeg; name="image002.jpg"
Content-Description: image002.jpg
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="image002.jpg"; size=158643;
	creation-date="Mon, 15 Sep 2018 02:44:21 GMT";
	modification-date="Mon, 15 Sep 2018 02:44:21 GMT"
Content-ID: <image002.jpg@01D4247D.2394E720>
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

...
```
Since the images was base64-encoded, we could extract all the blob words, put it into [Cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false) and download the `Output` part to see the real content inside the image.


Once decoded, both `image002.jpg` and `image003.jpg` reveals a Splunk column chart showing CPU usage over time for various endpoints.

Affected endpoints include, these are the same hosts we investigated in earlier questions. Bud visualized how their CPU usage spiked due to cryptojacking when visiting the compromised Frothly site.

#### Question 18 (218): What IAM user access key generates the most distinct errors when attempting to access IAM resources?

When I first read this question, I tried to link it to the previous one. However, it quickly became clear that this might point to a completely different AWS security incident, especially when you look ahead to the next question.

Before diving into the investigation, it’s helpful to revisit how [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html) work

ARNs are unique identifiers for AWS resources and typically follow one of these formats:
- `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id`
- `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id`
- `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id`

You can refer to the AWS documentation above for a breakdown of each field.

Since the question involves IAM resources, we filtered the logs for relevant entries using the following Splunk query:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail AND userIdentity.arn=*iam* AND eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com
AND errorMessage!=""
|table user src_ip user_access_key errorMessage reason
```
![pic29](assets/images/botsv3/pic29.png)

This revealed several repeated error messages tied to various users. To determine which access key triggered the most distinct IAM errors, we can simply count the number of unique reasons per access key:

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail AND userIdentity.arn=*iam* AND eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com
AND errorMessage!=""
|table user src_ip user_access_key errorMessage reason
|stats dc(reason) by user_access_key
```
![pic30](assets/images/botsv3/pic30.png)

From the results, we identified the key `AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA` as the one associated with the highest number of distinct error messages. Digging deeper, we determined that this access key belongs to the IAM user `web_admin`.

![pic31](assets/images/botsv3/pic31.png)

Further inspection of this user’s activity reveals suspicious behavior, potentially indicating that the AWS account has been compromised.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail AND userIdentity.arn=*iam* AND eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com
AND errorMessage!="" AND user_access_key=AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA
|reverse 
|table _time userIdentity.userName src_ip userAgent reason
```

![pic32](assets/images/botsv3/pic32.png)

I checked the associated IP addresses to see if they matched any from the previous `coinhive` browser-based cryptojacking incident, but found no overlap. Based on that, it might appears this is a separate incident.

#### Question 19 (219): Bud accidentally commits AWS access keys to an external code repository. Shortly after, he receives a notification from AWS that the account had been compromised. What is the support case ID that Amazon opens on his behalf?

This question further confirms our earlier suspicion - an actual security incident involving a compromised IAM user has occurred.

Accidentally pushing AWS credentials to a public code repository is a serious cloud security concern and goes against best practices. Platforms like GitHub or GitLab often automatically scan repositories and notify users if secrets are exposed. In this case, it appears that’s exactly what happened.

Since we already built a timeline for the Stage 1 incident, we can cross-reference that with the SMTP logs to check if any alert emails were received during the relevant window.

```sql
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:smtp 
AND earliest="08/20/2018:16:16:12" AND latest="08/20/2018:16:30:00"
|spath "receiver_alias{}" 
|search "receiver_alias{}"="bstoll@froth.ly"
```

This query returned one event from `no-reply-aws@amazon.com`, which confirms that AWS notified Bud Stoll of the incident.

The `content_body` of the email provides clear evidence that the `web_admin` IAM user's credentials had been exposed and subsequently abused:

```log
     Amazon Web Services has opened case 5244329601 on your behalf.

     Case ID: 5244329601
Subject: Your AWS account 622676721278
      is compromised
Severity: Urgent
Correspondence: Dear AWS Customer,

Your AWS Account is compromised! Please review the following notice and take immediate action to secure your account.

Your security is important to us. We have become aware that the AWS Access Key AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA (belonging to IAM user "web_admin") along with the corresponding Secret Key is publicly available online at https://github.com/FrothlyBeers/BrewingIOT/blob/e4a98cc997de12bb7a59f18aea207a28bcec566c/MyDocuments/aws_credentials.bak.

This poses a security risk to your account and other users, could lead to excessive charges from unauthorized activity or abuse, and violates the AWS Customer Agreement.

Please delete the exposed credentials from your AWS account by using the instructions below and take steps to prevent any new credentials from being published in this manner again. Unfortunately, deleting the keys from the public website and/or disabling them is NOT sufficient to secure your account.

To additionally protect your account from excessive charges, we have temporarily limited your ability to create some AWS resources. Please note that this does not make your account secure, it just partially limits the unauthorized usage for which you could be charged.

Detailed instructions are included below for your convenience.

CHECK FOR UNAUTHORIZED USAGE
We strongly encourage you to immediately review your AWS account for any unauthorized A
     WS usage, suspect running instances, or inappropriate IAM users and policies. To check the usage, please log into your AWS Management Console and go to each service page to see what resources are being used. Please pay special attention to the running EC2 instances and IAM users, roles, and groups. You can also check for any unexpected usage on the "Bills" page in the Billing console.

https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bill

Please keep in mind that unauthorized usage can occur in any region and that in your console you only see one region at a time. To switch between regions, you can use the dropdown in the top-right corner of the console screen.

DELETE THE KEY (ROOT ACCOUNT)
If you are not using the access key, you can simply delete it. To delete the exposed key, visit the "Security Credentials" page here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential. Your keys will be listed in the "Access Keys" section.

DELETE THE KEY (IAM USERS)
Navigate to your IAM Users list in the AWS Management Console, here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users. Please select the IAM user identified above. Click on the "User Actions" drop-down menu and then click "Manage Access Keys" to show that user's active Access Keys. Click "Delete" next to the access key identified above.

ROTATE THE KEY
If your application uses the access key, you need to replace the exposed key with a new one. To do this, first create a second key (at that point both keys will be active) and modify your application to use the new key.
Then disable (but do not delete) the first key. If there are any problems with your application, you can make the first key active again. When your application is fully functional with the first key inactive, please delete the first key.

Please follow the Best Practices of Managing your Access Keys at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html.

If you have any additional questions or concerns regarding this notification, please reach out to us via the AWS Support Center: https://aws.amazon.com/support.

#### Question 20 (220): AWS access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (e.g., AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (e.g., wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). What is the secret access key of the key that was leaked to the external code repository?

By followed the link provided in the AWS email notification: (Exposed Repo)(https://github.com/FrothlyBeers/BrewingIOT/blob/e4a98cc997de12bb7a59f18aea207a28bcec566c/MyDocuments/aws_credentials.bak)

We found credentials for the `web_admin` IAM user, including both the access key ID and the secret access key, confirming that the secret was exposed publicly.

```shell
[web_admin]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAJOGCDXJ5NW5PXUPA
aws_secret_access_key = ****************dROqhELPtXJSR9vFPNGk
region = us-west-1
```

While reviewing the rest of the repository, i found additional information pointing to Frothly’s infrastructure.

![pic33](assets/images/botsv3/pic33.png)
_A full layout of the Frothly AWS environment was exposed_

Beside of it, a separate alert about a data leakage incident was present.

![pic34](assets/images/botsv3/pic34.png)

A file named [dump.csv](https://github.com/FrothlyBeers/BrewingIOT/blob/e4a98cc997de12bb7a59f18aea207a28bcec566c/MyDocuments/dump.csv) appears to contain a list of users whose data may have been compromised.

At this point, we’ve clearly identified the entry point of this incident: the public exposure of web_admin’s AWS credentials. From here, we can trace further steps in the adversary’s attack path and assess the impact.

**Victim**
- `web_admin` - compromised AWS user

**Malicous Contens**
- `35.153.154.221` - potentially adversary IP Address
- `209.107.196.112` - potentially adversary IP Address
- `82.102.18.111` - potentially adversary IP Address

**Tactics / Techniques**
- **Initial Access (TA0001)**
  - Valid Accounts.Cloud Accounts (T1072.004)

#### Question 21 (221): Using the leaked key, the adversary makes an unauthorized attempt to create a key for a specific resource. What is the name of that resource? Answer guidance: One word.

Looking back at the initial activity logs following the leak of the `web_admin` credentials, we can observe the adversary’s first set of actions after gaining access to Frothly's AWS environment.

From these logs, it’s clear the attacker attempted to escalate privileges and create new access credentials `my_db_user`. The main target appears to be a user named `nullweb_admin`, as multiple unauthorized actions were attempted against this identity.

These failed actions suggest the adversary’s intention was to maintain access by creating a new user with fresh credentials, likely to persist in the environment undetected.

#### Question 22 (222): Using the leaked key, the adversary makes an unauthorized attempt to describe an account. What is the full user agent string of the application that originated the request?

As seen in the logs from the previous question, the adversary attempted to enumerate permissions and access details using a specific client application. The final log entry reveals the use of a tool named **ElasticWolf**

>[ElasticWolf](https://github.com/Osndok/ElasticWolf) is a GUI-based client for managing AWS resources. Its usage here is significant, as it shows the adversary wasn't just running scripts, they used a management console, likely to explore, manage, or exfiltrate data manually.

![pic35](assets/images/botsv3/pic35.webp)

This unauthorized action: `iam:GetUser` was performed by `web_admin` using the ElasticWolf interface, further proving their goal of investigating existing permissions and potentially escalating privileges. This adds to the narrative that the attacker was actively trying to enumerate and abuse IAM policies and credentials.
